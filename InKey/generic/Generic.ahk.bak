;________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
; This section is required at the top of every InKey keyboard script:

K_MinimumInKeyLibVersion = 0.094
	; The version number of the InKeyLib.ahki file that the keyboard developer used while writing this script.
	; It can be found near the top of the InKeyLib.ahki file.
	; It may be lower than the InKey version number.
	; If a user has an older version of InKeyLib.ahki, he will need to update it in order to use this keyboard script.
	; This protects your script from crashing from attempting to use functionality not present in older versions of InKeyLib.ahki.

K_UseContext = 1	; Causes uncaptured character keys to be included in the context too.

#include InKeyLib.ahki

OnLoadScript:	; This section is executed when this InKey script is first loaded.
